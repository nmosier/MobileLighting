The current state of image processing on the iPhone:
1. Caputures the photos
2. Converts them to grayscale
3. Combines identical images of different exposures
4. Thresholds the images using the zero-crossing algorithm
5. Decodes the images
6. Sends the one vertical & one horizontal decoded image to the Mac
